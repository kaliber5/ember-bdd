# Glossary


## BDD, in a narrow sense

An approach to coding which adds a second loop to the TDD cycle: you are supposed to write an acceptance test before writing a unit test. It also implies a different style of writing assertions: `expect` or `should` instead of `assert`.



## BDD, in a broad sense


A methodology of software development, which involves all the team, not only developers. When a feature is conceived, it is captured in form of human-readable user stories. These user stories serve as a spec and are used to guide and validate development from planning to deployment.


## Cucumber

Initially, an automated testing library designed for BDD in Ruby. Today, an industry standard approach to BDD, popular in almost every programming language.
