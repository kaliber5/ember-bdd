Lots of developers have tried Cucumber and found that it caused more trouble than it solved.</p>\n<p>Many developers on their path to embrace BDD, including me, have started as avid Cucumber enthusiasts and then got severely disappointed, or got their teammates on ‚Äî or over ‚Äî the fence.</p>\n<p>I'm convinced that it's not Cucumber to blame, rather it's the misuse of the tool that causes grief. In much the same way, it would be ridiculous to advocate against using kitchen knives because you have cut your finger. üòè</p>\n<p>I have identified a number of issues with how Cucumber is typically used and, I believe, successfully solved them in this addon. The resulting approach is quite radical and quite effective. Read on!</p>\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://github.com/lolmaus\">Andrey Mikhaylov @lolmaus</a></p>","title":"What and Why"}}}
